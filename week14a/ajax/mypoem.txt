<p id="verse1">apparently it is ungrateful of me<br>
to mention my period in public<br>
cause the actual biology<br>
of my body is too real</p>

<p id="verse2">it is okay to sell what's<br>
between a woman's legs<br>
more than it is okay to<br>
mention its inner workings</p>

<p id="verse3">the recreational use of<br>
this body is seen as<br>
beautiful while<br>
its nature is<br>
seen as ugly</p>
